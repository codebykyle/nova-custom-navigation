# This is a work in progress
This package is to manage custom navigation inside of Laravel Nova.

The goal of this package is to provide support for grouped resources
and provide a dashboard for grouped models.

This package focuses on large Laravel projects with alot of models and resources,
and aims to trim down sidebar navigation, as well as provide navigation to 
primarily top level resources

This package accepts pull requests at this time, however, this package is incomplete
and should be used with caution
